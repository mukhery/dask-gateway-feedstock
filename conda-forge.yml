  #        successful in declaring the target_platform.

  win_64: win_64

# provider for linux_aarch64 has to be set explicitly as it otherwise defaults

provider:
  # build_platform: provider of ci workers
  linux_64: azure
  # linux_aarch64 is declared as native but is probably emulated behind the
  # scenes as its very slow running.

  # osx_arm64 isn't available natively from any provider of CI workers yet

# tests are run only when build_platform matches target_platform (native). This
# is currently always the case, but that may change if we manage to
# cross-compile going forward.
